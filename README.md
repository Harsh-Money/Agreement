# Agreement
Backend Project where 2 people will agree on agreement and have a digital signature over it.

# Project Scope
## Purpose
We aim to develop a backend project that facilitates **secure** and **efficient** agreements between individuals.

## Goal
Imagine a scenario involving two people:

- **Cake Maker:** A professional who creates custom cakes.
- **Father:** A man planning a birthday celebration for his daughter and looking to order a cake.

### Process:
1. **Agreement Creation:**
    - The father visits our platform, where cake makers are listed.
    - He creates an agreement specifying his cake requirements.

2. **Digital Signatures:**
    - Both the father and the cake maker digitally sign the agreement to confirm the order.

3. **Agreement Management:**
    - The agreement is securely stored in our system.
    - The system automatically sends reminders to both parties one day before and on the day of the cake delivery.

4. **Security:**
    - Both parties can view the agreement but are restricted from deleting it unless they mutually agree to cancel the contract by adding their digital signatures.

## Features
- **Secure Storage:** All agreements are encrypted and securely stored.
- **Automatic Reminders:** The system sends timely reminders to both parties.
- **Digital Signatures:** Ensures that agreements are legally binding.
